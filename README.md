This is the code repository for [Hands-On Intelligent Agents with OpenAI Gym](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-intelligent-agents-openai-gym?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788836579), published by Packt.

**Implement intelligent agents using PyTorch to solve classic AI problems, play console games like Atari, and perform tasks such as autonomous driving using the CARLA driving simulator**

## What is this book about?
Many real-world problems can be broken down into tasks that require a series of decisions to be made or actions to be taken. The ability to solve such tasks without a machine being programmed requires a machine to be artificially intelligent and capable of learning to adapt. This book is an easy-to-follow guide to implementing learning algorithms for machine software agents in order to solve discrete or continuous sequential decision making and control tasks.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore intelligent agents and learning environments 
* Understand the basics of RL and deep RL 
* Get started with OpenAI Gym and PyTorch for deep reinforcement learning 
* Discover deep Q learning agents to solve discrete optimal control tasks 
* Create custom learning environments for real-world problems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gym
env = gym.make("Qbert-v0")
MAX_NUM_EPISODES = 10
MAX_STEPS_PER_EPISODE = 500
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If youâ€™re a student, game/machine learning developer, or AI enthusiast looking to get started with building intelligent agents and algorithms to solve a variety of problems with the OpenAI Gym interface, this book is for you. You will also find this book useful if you want to learn how to build deep reinforcement learning-based agents to solve problems in your domain of interest. Though the book covers all the basic concepts that you need to know, some working knowledge of Python programming language will help you get the most out of it.

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/HandsOnIntelligentAgentswithOpenAIGym_ColorImages.pdf).
